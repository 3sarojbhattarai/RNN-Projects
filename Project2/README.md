# Multi-step Time Series Forecasting with Machine Learning for Electricity Usage

Given the rise of smart electricity meters and the wide adoption of electricity generation technology like solar panels, there
is a wealth of electricity usage data available. This data represents a multivariate time series of power-related variables 
that in turn could be used to model and even forecast future electricity consumption.

The ‘Household Power Consumption‘ dataset is a multivariate time series dataset that describes the electricity consumption for 
a single household over four years.The data was collected between December 2006 and November 2010 and observations of power 
consumption within the household were collected every minute.

It is a multivariate series comprised of seven variables (besides the date and time). They are:

**global_active_power**: The total active power consumed by the household (kilowatts).  
**global_reactive_power** : The total reactive power consumed by the household (kilowatts).  
**voltage** : Average voltage (volts).  
**global_intensity** : Average current intensity (amps).  
**sub_metering_1**: Active energy for kitchen (watt-hours of active energy).  
**sub_metering_2**: Active energy for laundry (watt-hours of active energy).  
**sub_metering_3**: Active energy for climate control systems (watt-hours of active energy).
