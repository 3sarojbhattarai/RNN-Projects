# Automated Essay Grading

Today, state departments of education are developing new forms of testing and grading methods, to assess the new common 
core standards.  In this environment the need for more sophisticated and affordable options is vital.  For example, we 
know that essays are an important expression of academic achievement, but they are expensive and time consuming for states 
to grade them by hand.  So, we are frequently limited to multiple-choice standardized tests.  We believe that automated 
scoring systems can yield fast, effective and affordable solutions that would allow states to introduce essays and other 
sophisticated testing tools.
