# Stock Market Prediction Using RNN

Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument 
traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit. The efficient-market
hypothesis suggests that stock prices reflect all currently available information and any price changes that are not based on 
newly revealed information thus are inherently unpredictable. Others disagree and those with this viewpoint possess myriad 
methods and technologies which purportedly allow them to gain future price information.
